### Debugging

- When Building my webpage from a mobile screen to start witjh, I had issues to conten not following its default postions when increasing the screen size to tabelt or browser size. I soon realised that this was going get me to rewrite a lot of css when writing the mark up for media quires. I decided to create my html mark up in browser size first and then add media quires to a small er screeen size. This was an effective method. 

- My first experience with bugs was when adding links to my nav Bar. I had issues using the Ancore tag with a href attribute. Once creating a new page in my file paths, I could not get the two pages link via the Nav bar. My solution was to look back over the Love Running project, to see how the anchor tag worked. From there I added my my own markup and fixed the issue.

- When validating my css mark up, I had erros as to using a % value for letter-spacing. To clear the error, I changed the value tp px.

- When validating my html mark up, an error flagged up (header open). The issue was that I had wrapped a h1 elment around an icon. I believed wrapping an icon in a h1 would be the best practice for styling purposes. 
I researched using W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/ to get an understaning to styling icons in css. To solve this error, I removed the h1 element and left it in it's original anchor tag.
