### Nav-Bar
- The Podcast Project has four clickable navigation links (navigation menu) at the top of all pages. These are intended to navigate the user across the webpage to explore more content and pages that they would like to visit. These four pages consist of a homepage, an about us page, a listen page and a sign up page. The styling of these links in the header, matches that of the footer.

### Home-page
- The header section of the landing page (Homepage) has a Hero-image which covers a full width of 100% and 600px height. The image it self is inspired to show the user what the webpage is about, just by viewing the main image. An alternative text for the image, is placed for users who require a screen reader.

![home page image](assets/images/url3.png)

### Main Content
- This part of the main page invites the user to explore more by adding a short but brief piece of text. It will encourage the user to go beyond the homepage and navigate to the section below.

- Below the header there are two images and two clickable links under each image. This will navigate the user to the listen page, in which they can view more content. Navigating the user to the listen page will help user to explore more within the listen page itself.

- For mobile screen sizes of a max-width 375px, the images and links are removed. This is to reduce the amount of information displayed on smaller sizes as lots of content can be harder to read on this screen 

![two images and links](readme/url%204.png)

### Debugging
- When Building my webpage from a mobile screen to start witjh, I had issues to conten not following its default postions when increasing the screen size to tabelt or browser size. I soon realised that this was going get me to rewrite a lot of css when writing the mark up for media quires. I decided to create my html mark up in browser size first and then add media quires to a small er screeen size. This was an effective method. 

- My first experience with bugs was when adding links to my nav Bar. I had issues using the Ancore tag with a href attribute. Once creating a new page in my file paths, I could not get the two pages link via the Nav bar. My solution was to look back over the Love Running project, to see how the anchor tag worked. From there I added my my own markup and fixed the issue.

- When validating my css mark up, I had erros as to using a % value for letter-spacing. To clear the error, I changed the value tp px.

- When validating my html mark up, an error flagged up (header open). The issue was that I had wrapped a h1 element around an icon within the header on all pages. I believed wrapping an icon in a h1 would be the best practice for styling purposes in css. Once I had researched through W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/ to get an understanding to adding Icons into the html and what elements to use on them I went back and solved this error, I removed the h1 element and left it in it's original anchor tag, then in my css, I selevted the anchor element for styling aloing with it's class name.
