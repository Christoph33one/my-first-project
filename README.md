# Features 

### Icon
- A clickable homepage icon is located at the top left of all pages. The icon is clickable and will navigate the user back to the top of the homepage. This is designed to give the user a simple but powerful way of getting back to the start of the homepage. In keeping with modern design from other websites, the icon is fixed (display:fixed;) to the top left when scrolling from header to footer on all pages. 

![icon image](readme/url2.png)

---

### Nav-Bar
- The Podcast Project has four clickable navigation links (navigation menu) at the top of all pages. These are intended to navigate the user across the webpage to explore more content and pages that they would like to visit. These four pages consist of a homepage, an about us page, a listen page and a sign up page. The styling of these links in the header, matches that of the footer.

![nav bar image](readme/nav%20bar%20.png)

---

### Homepage
- The header section of the landing page (homepage) has a Hero-image which covers a full width of 100%. The image itself is inspired to show the user what the webpage is about, just by viewing the main image. An alternative text for the image is placed for users who require a screen reader.

![home page image](assets/images/url3.png)

---

### Main content
- This part of the main page invites the user to explore more by adding a short but brief piece of text. It will encourage the user to go beyond the homepage and navigate to the section below.

![](readme/url%202.png)

- Below the header there are two images and two clickable links under each image. This will navigate the user to the listen page, in which they can view more content. Navigating the user to the listen page will help user to explore more within the listen page itself.

- For mobile screen sizes of a max-width 300px, the images and links are removed. This is to reduce the amount of information displayed on smaller sizes as lots of content can be harder to read on this screen size.

![two images and links](readme/url%204.png)

---

### Footer
- The footer section contains three socail media links and a video media link Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/

- All three media links match the color scheme of the nav bar in the header of the webpage. In keeping with the colors from header to footer, it creates a symmetrical feel to the page.

![](readme/url%206.png)

- At the bottom of all pages, you will find a Copyright symbol and text.

![](readme/url8.png)

---

### About 
- The about us page gives the user a brief piece of information on the creators behind the idea - Who are we? It creates a trustworthy feel on management of the website before entering personal details and signing up.

- Styling for the header image is copied from the main homepage to provide a sense of symmetry and keeping the idea that the website is about listening.

- Below the about us section is the address of the company, this is also shared to create trust with the website.


![](readme/url7.png)

---

### Listen
- The listen page is where the user will find five podcast samples to try out by just clicking on a link under each explanation of a topic.

- The images (left) will give the user a visual way of knowing what type of topic will be covered. Images are also used to give color to the page.

- A brief piece of text (right) along side each image will explain to the user what this topic covers.

- A link description added above each clickable link will give the user information on what and who they will be listening to before clicking.

- In mobile screen sizes of a max-width 300px, the listen page will have a new layout, this is to be more user friendly when lookin at the images and text.
![](readme/url%2010.png)

---

### Sign Up 
- The sign up page is the final page to explore, this page gives the user an opportunity to enter personal information and sign up.

- Personal details required - first name, last name, email, user name, password.

- For design and styling, the sign up page uses a background image. It is intended to give the user an idea that this is separate from the other pages but also keeping the theme of the website. The use of a yellow border is to highlight the form more clearly over the bright background image.

- Once the user has entered all information correctly, they will be navigated to a thank you page. This is to give conformation to the user that their personal detials have been sent.

### Browser Tests
 - Google Chrome

 - Safari 

- The Home icon has been tested on all pages with it's display fixed feature from header to footer. It's feature being clickable was also tested on all pages, making sure it navigates the user back to the home page.

- The nav bar has been tested on all pages, making sure it navigates the user to the required page. From home page to a thank you conformation page when you sign up.

- All media links are wrapped in an anchor tab. The testing here is to make sure that all links open on a separate browser and to the correct video or website selected.

- All inputs in the form section have been tested by entering text and making sure the (required) feature works when entering information before you can submit. 

- The submit and reset buttons for the form page have been tested. The reset button will delete all text in all input boxes when clicked. The submit button is clickable and sends the user to the conformation page (thank you page).

- All media quiries have been tested through Google Chrome developer tools. Testing was focused on mobile screen sizes the most, as some content is removed on a mobile device.

- The Podcast Project has been tested with it's responsiveness in four screen sizes and devices. These devices are, an iPhone SE, iPad mini, a latop screen size of 1200px and in a browser screen size. 
Developer tools in Google Chrome where used in the creating and testing of the webistes responsiveness, along with the help of I Am Responsive https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://christoph33one.github.io/my-first-project/index.html.

# Mark up

- The Podcast Project used html5 and css to input all written markup.

---

### Debugging
- When building my webpage for a mobile screen size I had issues with content not following its default positions when increasing the screen size to tablet or browser size. I soon realised that this would require for me to rewrite a lot of css when writing the mark up for media quieries. I decided to create my html mark up in browser size first and then add media quires to a smaller screeen size. This was an effective method. 

- My first experience with bugs was when adding links to my nav bar. I had issues using the anchor tag with a href attribute. Once creating a new page in my file paths, I could not get the two pages link via the nav bar. My solution was to look back over the Love Running project, to see how the anchor tag worked. From there I added my own markup and fixed the issue.

- When validating my css mark up, I had erros as to using a % value for letter-spacing. To clear the error, I changed the value to px.

- When validating my html mark up, an error flagged up (header open). The issue was that I had wrapped a h1 element around an icon within the header on all pages. I believed wrapping an icon in a h1 would be the best practice for styling purposes in css. Once I had researched through W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/ to get an understanding of adding icons into the html and what elements to use on them I went back and solved this error. I removed the h1 element and left it in it's original anchor tag, then in my css, I selected the anchor element for styling along with it's class name.

# Acknowledgments
- With the help fof W3schools, I was able to follow some code syntax and then apply my own mark up and styles in html and css.

My fisrt project with Code Institute was built using Github and Gitpod. With the tools provided I have created a website using html and css only. I would like to say thank you to Code Institute for providing me with the tools to build my first project. A big thank you to the slack community for all the support throughout the project. 
To my mentor, tutor support and student care, for providing advice and keeping me on track with the project.
